# ðŸ™‚ Sentiment Analysis for Stock Picks
A Python application that performs sentiment analysis on news articles containing specific company names to assist in stock selection and observe Efficient Market Hypothesis.

## Introduction
This project aims to help users make better stock picks by performing sentiment analysis on news articles related to specific companies. The application scrapes live news articles, searches for mentions of a given company name, and calculates the average sentiment score based on the article content. A user-friendly GUI allows users to input the desired stock and select news sources for analysis, presenting the sentiment score and distribution per news article visually.

**NOTE:** Due to rate limiting issues during web scraping, the current implementation uses a stub dataset as a workaround. If you wish to use the stub dataset, input the stock name as "microsoft" and choose any company. The code is located in news_article_factory.py and the stubbing is controlled by the variable use_stub. To disable stubbing and attempt to scrape articles directly, set use_stub to False.

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow
